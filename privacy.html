Privacy Policy
Last updated: [2025-08-27]

This Chrome extension ("Extension") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use the Extension.

1. Information We Collect

Account Credentials (Instagram username and password)
The Extension stores your Instagram login credentials only in your local browser storage.
These credentials are encrypted using AES-GCM and are never transmitted to any external server.

Other Data
The Extension does not collect, track, or store any other personal information.

2. How We Use Information

The credentials stored in your local browser are used only for the purpose of logging into Instagram accounts as requested by the user.

No data is shared with the developer or any third parties.

3. Data Security

All account credentials are encrypted before being stored in Chrome's chrome.storage.local.

The encryption key is derived from a device-specific random seed combined with the extension ID, meaning only your current browser profile can decrypt the data.

4. Data Sharing

We do not send any data to external servers.

We do not share your data with third parties.

5. Google Translate Feature

If you enable the Google Translate option, the page uses Google Translate widget to translate content. This is provided by Google and subject to Googleâ€™s own Privacy Policy.

6. Your Control

You can remove stored accounts at any time through the extension interface.

Uninstalling the extension will delete all stored data.
